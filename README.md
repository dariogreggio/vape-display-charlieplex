# vape-display-charlieplex
using a dismissed display from Vape

It's a 2 1/2 digit nice oled, and uses charlieplexing on 5 pins.
Project made for a PIC18F2620 in C language

(optimizations pending, but this is just a demo!)

NEW: added a project for an 8pin (12F683 or alike) so that the display can be driven via a simple RS-232 interface!
